Public API
----------
Investigation of public api should start with determining of all available endpoints.
Endpoints can be determined by examining the URI field of the HTTP_LOG_ITEM.

For VMG we have the following endpoints:

	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/InvoiceExporter
	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/OrderImport
	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/Shipment
	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/ConfirmationMessage
	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/SgnShipment
	https://itos-api.vanmoergroup.com/api/Delivery
	
	http://ws.edi.vanmoergroup.com/BizTalkiTOSRestService/DeliveryService.svc/OutboundDelivery/0080016941
	http://ws12-vmg10biz02/api/ContainerDischargingFromDepot/
	http://ws12-vmg10biz02/api/ContainerLoadingToDepot/

For VLN we have endpoints:

http://192.168.17.17/api/VasPackagingOrder/
http://10.1.0.101/api/DischargingShipBulkHatchEnd
http://192.168.17.17/api/DischargingShipBulkOrder/
https://itos-api.vlaeynatie.eu/api/ContainerDischargingFromDepot/
http://10.1.0.101/api/DischargingShipBulkEnd
http://10.1.0.101/api/DischargingShipBulkStart
http://itos-papi.vlaeynatie.eu/api/DischargingShipBulkWeight
http://yahoo.com/api/DischargingShipBulkOrder/
http://10.1.0.101/api/DischargingShipBulkWeight
https://itos-api.vlaeynatie.eu/api/DischargingShipBulkWeight
http://itos-api.vlaeynatie.eu/api/DischargingShipBulkWeight

Reportings can be deleted only if they are 'Open', and their Pending - Reported > 0. In other words reporting must have all its pending to be deletable. If some of the pending was
processed and Pending is < Reported, then the reporting cannot be deleted.

-- Plannings , Remainings, Pendings etc are all in sync. See OnStockRemoving and OnStockRemoved handlers for example of pannings being deleted.

When palletizing 2 ois are created: stock change and loading
In stock change location to is set (how?) and packaging unit is set to change from 'None' to ExternalId.

------------------ TO UPDATE INVENTORY DIRECTLY --------------------------
get the inventory requests from here

select * from HTTP_LOG_ITEM where URI like '%InventoryRequest/' and REQUEST_TIMESTAMP between '2016-09-28 09:40' and '2016-09-28 09:42'

and here

select *, SUBSTRING(REQUEST_CONTENT, 1, 30000) as REQ1,
	SUBSTRING(REQUEST_CONTENT, 30000, len(REQUEST_CONTENT)-30000 + 1) as REQ2,
	len(REQUEST_CONTENT) as Len
from HTTP_LOG_ITEM where URI like '%InventoryRequest/' and REQUEST_TIMESTAMP between '2016-09-28 09:40' and '2016-09-28 09:42'
	and len(REQUEST_CONTENT) > 30000

in the request replace '>k__BackingField' and '<' with nothing.

adjust RequestType
remove all "StorageQuantity": null, lines
you can also remove "StockInfoId":###, "StockInfoConfigId": ###, "BaseQuantityId": ###, "StorageQuantityId": ###, "Id": ###

for customs request
remove all "ExtraUnitsIds": null, lines
remove all "ExtraQuantities": null, lines

You don't generally need a lot of properties, like 'CreateUser', 'CreateTimeStamp', most ids are not needed, etc.

Make sure Async is false
Very important, stock inventory request must have status, and it must be 'Open' (this can be 0 or 1 depending on version), otherwise nothing happens.

See siRequest.txt, siReq2.txt, ciRequest.txt for examples of stock inventory request / customs inventory request

Q: How does this
    var persister = Persistence.GetPersister<StockInfoQuantityModel>();
    persister.Save(model);
Save a StockInfoQty object?

Q: Why do we need this
    public class StockInfoQuantityModel : PresentationModel<int>
    {
		...
        public dynamic StorageUnits { get; set; } // what is the dynamic for?
