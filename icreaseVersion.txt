Do we have to increase the version?
1. We increase version on Production branch only.
2. Check when AssemblyVersion was modified.
3. Check if there's a deployment pkg in \\tfs\deploy\DeploymentPackages\...
	which is after the Assembly Version modif date (check the date from the filename or extract pkg to see version inside)
4. Get latest
