You get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites.

For Project pages, the gh-pages branch is used to publish your site. That means that you can work with GitHub Pages in the same repository as the project that it's for, without affecting the project itself.

Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io/repository
e.g. lamyata.github.io/lmenu
